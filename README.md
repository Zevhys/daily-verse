<sub>_The Cattle_</sub><br>
**Surah Al-An'am** (6: 124)

> Whenever a sign comes to them, they say, “We will never believe until we receive what Allah’s messengers received.” Allah knows best where to place His message. The wicked will soon be overwhelmed by humiliation from Allah and a severe punishment for their evil plots.
